# Cryptorium / React Cryptocurrency App 



Cryptorium provides various services about cryptocurrencies such as the latest crypto news, the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the world, showing market stats.
In this project, I used Coinranking API to get the data about all cryptocurrencies. Then Bing News Search API helped to provide news resources. You can find these in [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/)

Accessing the exchanges section is not possible because a premium plan is required. I use a free plan.
  

I built this project because I was aiming to enhance my state management skills using redux and also UI design skills using Ant Design.
